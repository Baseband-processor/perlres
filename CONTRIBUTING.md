### Emojis
Take github emojis from this [list](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)

#### Emojis in titles
- Categories (means `## :rocket: Second level title`) should have an emoji
- Sub Categories (means `### Third level title`) should NOT have an emoji 

#### Emojis in list items

Emojis does not always have a meaning for instance for **CMS** software I use :memo: :pencil2: :clipboard: and friends...

Sometimes I use something else related to the software itself : **ACT** has a :seat: because it's related to conferences and people sitting in a room to listen talks.

Webframeworks are generaly animals :cow: :bear: :frog: :hamster: because I needed a lot of different emojis and they are cool :relieved:

We could have used the same emoji for all CMS, but having different one and putting them randomly looks *prettier* :innocent:

:warning: Some emojis are not compatible with mobiles, please do not use them.

## Tips

For the links, choose first the official website (if any) then the [github repository](https://github.com/) then the [metaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/)

If you put official website first, you can provide a [github link](https://github.com/) (or a [metaCPAN link](https://metacpan.org/)) at the end of the line.

Remember that this is not stricly a module list like [Task::Kensho](https://github.com/EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho) otherwise I would have chosen in priority the [metaCPAN link](https://metacpan.org/)
.

Stay concise.

## Quality Standard

This list is not for *people with a minimum Perl background*. 

It can be used by people that do not know Perl but you don't have to make this list fully accessible for them.

Old softwares could appear, even if not maintained for years, but only if they seems not completely dead.
