Iâ€™m really glad that you are interested in contributing to **perlres** !

First of all, respect great predecessors and all contributors in Perl community.

This guide is inspired by awesome-perl [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/hachiojipm/awesome-perl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Contribution Guidelines

* **To add to the list**: Submit a pull request
* **To remove from the list**: Open an issue (you must describe a reason!)

## Formatting
### Example of Item of List

```
- :dancer: [Dancer](http://perldancer.org/) - Minimalist Web framework created by [Alexis Sukrieh](https://metacpan.org/author/SUKRIA)
```

### Emojies
Take github emojis from this [list](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)

#### Emojies in titles
- Categories (means `## Second level title`) should have an emoji.
- Sub Categories (means `### Tird level title`) should NOT have an emoji 

#### Emojies in list items
- Emojies does not always have a meaning
For instance for **CMS** software I use :memo:, :pencil:, :clipboard: and friends...
But sometimes I use something else related to the software itself : **ACT** has a seat because it's related to conferences and people sitting in a room to listen talks.

Another example is webframeworks that are generaly are animals (because I needed a lot of different emojies). 

We could have used the same emoji for all CMS, but having different one and putting them randomly looks *prettier* :innocent:

:warning: Some emojies are not compatible with mobiles, please do not use them.

## Tips

For the links, choose first the official website (if any) then the github repository then the metaCPAN.
If you put official website first, you can provide a github link (or a metaCPAN link) at the end of the line.
Remember that this is not stricly a module list like [Task::Kensho](https://github.com/EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho) otherwise I would have chosen in priority the metaCPAN link.

Stay concise.

## Quality Standard

This list is not for *people who do not know much about Perl*. It could be used by these people of course but the main target is people with a minimum Perl background.

Old softwares could appear, even if not maintained for years, but only if they seems not completely dead (some help needed already on this topic).

## Rule

* Add a few modules to one category in one pull-request.
